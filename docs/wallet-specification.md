# Wallet Specification for DeFi Vault

## TL;DR

This specification outlines the integration of wallet functionality for our DeFi vault using Plurality middleware. We will initially support MetaMask, providing users with a secure and seamless experience for connecting wallets, depositing, withdrawing, and participating in governance, while laying the foundation for future institutional wallet support.

## Business & User Goals

### Business Goals

1. **Increase Adoption**: Streamline wallet connection to boost vault adoption and first-time user activation rates
2. **Enhance Trust**: Transparently meet security and regulatory compliance through Plurality-mediated interactions
3. **Boost Engagement**: Enable and track on-chain governance participation
4. **Gather Insights**: Collect actionable data on wallet interactions and transaction flows
5. **Build for Scale**: Establish a technical foundation for future institutional-grade wallet integrations

### User Goals

1. **Connect Easily**: Connect wallets via Plurality with minimal friction
2. **Manage Assets**: Perform swift and reliable deposits and withdrawals
3. **Participate in Governance**: Securely vote on on-chain proposals
4. **Receive Clear Feedback**: Get real-time, understandable transaction feedback
5. **Trust the System**: Clearly understand the security and compliance measures in place

### Non-Goals

- Multiple simultaneous wallet connections (single-session only for MVP)
- Institutional workflows (multi-sig, advanced permissions)
- Wallet key recovery services
- Fiat on/off-ramps in the MVP

## User Personas & Stories

### Personas

1. **Retail DeFi User (Primary)**: Uses MetaMask for trading, yield, and governance
2. **Institutional User (Future)**: Requires advanced wallet controls and permissions

### User Stories

- On error, explicit message with remediation steps is shown

#### Step 2: Deposit/Withdraw Assets
- User initiates transaction; Plurality manages MetaMask flow
- Real-time progress displayed with clear status indicators

#### Step 3: Governance Participation
- Users cast votes through connected wallet
- App guides through confirmations with security context

#### Step 4: Errors & Logout
- Session errors trigger secure logout with explanatory message
- Users can manually logout anytime

### Advanced Features

- Automatic logout on session timeout
- Warnings for account/network switching
- Browser support checks with actionable suggestions

### UI/UX Highlights

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## User Narrative

Samantha, a retail DeFi user, discovers our yield vault. She connects her MetaMask wallet via Plurality in two clicks, guided by a secure interface. As she deposits tokens, she receives immediate, plain-language feedback at every step. When voting on a governance proposal, the process is seamless with real-time confirmation. Trusting the system, she returns frequently, confident in a smooth and secure experience.

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics
- Percentage of successful wallet connections
- Conversion rate from connection to completed deposit/withdrawal
- Rate of governance participation

### Business Metrics
- Growth in unique wallet connections (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Increase in vault TVL (Total Value Locked)
- Reduction in wallet-related support tickets

### Technical Metrics
- Failed transaction rates
- Median connection and transaction processing times
- Uptime percentage for Plurality integration

## Technical Implementation

### Integration Architecture

Our wallet integration uses a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **UI Layer**: Displays wallet prompts, balances, transaction status, and error notifications
2. **Wallet Orchestration Layer**: Manages connection state, session lifecycle, error routing, and user flow logic
3. **Wallet Adapter Layer**: Implements wallet provider interface, with `PluralityWalletAdapter` as the conduit to Plurality
4. **Plurality Middleware (External)**: Provides wallet orchestration, compliance, and transaction services
5. **Repository/Auth Layers**: Manage local storage, vault data, and user authentication

### Key Integration Points

- Internal stack never connects directly to wallet APIs—all operations go through Plurality via adapters
- Adapters conform to a shared contract enabling clean future wallet integrations
- Only public wallet addresses are handled by Plurality—private keys remain with users

### Data & Privacy Considerations

- Store only public addresses and necessary transaction metadata
- No private keys or credentials are processed by the application or Plurality
- Regular compliance reviews ensure privacy standards are maintained

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: MetaMask Integration (2 weeks)
- Build wallet connection, transaction, and governance workflows via Plurality
- Deliver MVP supporting MetaMask for all targeted flows

### Phase 2: Extensibility Scaffold (1 week)
- Design and document adapter interfaces for additional wallets
- Create technical documentation for future wallet integrations

### Phase 3: Optimization & Institutional Pilot (1 week)
- Onboard pilot institutional users and collect feedback
- Document findings and plan for further enhancements

## Team & Resources

- 2 developers focused on wallet integration and orchestration logic
- 1 product owner for requirements, coordination, and QA
- Ad-hoc support from Plurality's technical team as needed

## Conclusion

By leveraging Plurality as our wallet middleware, we'll deliver a seamless, secure experience for retail users while building a foundation for future institutional features. This approach ensures compliance by design, reduces implementation complexity, and creates a unified approach to wallet management that can scale with our product.
