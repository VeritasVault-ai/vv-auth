# Technical Implementation

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

1. **UI Layer**: Displays wallet prompts, balances, transaction status, and error notifications.

2. **Wallet Orchestration Layer**: Orchestrates wallet operations—managing connection state, session lifecycle, error routing, and user flow logic.
   - After successful wallet connection, triggers an authentication challenge via the Auth Provider to begin login/signup (if the user is not already authenticated).
   - Orchestration and Auth Provider layers operate independently so that logging out from the app does not require disconnecting the wallet, and vice versa.

3. **Wallet Adapter Layer**: Implements a strict wallet-provider interface, with the `PluralityWalletAdapter` serving as the conduit to Plurality's middleware.
   - For all supported wallets, Adapters will interact through the Plurality.network middleware API.
   - The rest of the stack remains provider-agnostic and compliant by design.
   - This ensures that any integration, extension, or compliance enforcement leverages Plurality's orchestration, and shields the application from implementation-specific details of underlying wallet providers.

4. **Plurality Middleware (External)**: Offers wallet orchestration, error handling, compliance, and transaction relaying as a service—interfacing only with wallet adapters, not other layers.

5. **Repository/Auth Layers**: Manage local storage, vault data, and user authentication separate from wallet/session logic.

## Integration Points

- The internal stack never connects directly to MetaMask wallet APIs—instead, all wallet operations are mediated by Plurality via adapter interfaces.
- Adapters must conform to a shared contract (e.g., connect, sign, send, error notification, etc.), enabling clean future wallet integration.
- Only public wallet addresses are handled by Plurality—private keys are never touched, maintaining user privacy and trust.

## Data Storage & Privacy

- Store only public wallet addresses and necessary transaction metadata.
- No private credential or key data is ever processed by the application or Plurality.
- Regular compliance reviews to ensure privacy standards and periodic updates based on regulation.

## Scalability & Performance

- Plurality must handle potentially thousands of concurrent wallet sessions without degraded performance.
- All wallet connections and transactions should complete in under two seconds median time for optimal experience.

## Potential Challenges

- Plurality API evolution: System must monitor for breaking or deprecating changes in Plurality's API interface.
- Transparent user education: Users and support teams should have access to clear documentation to troubleshoot issues.
- Proactive error detection: Rapid, user-friendly escalation of all error states within the wallet flow.
