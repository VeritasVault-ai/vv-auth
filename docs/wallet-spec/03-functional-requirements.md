# Functional Requirements

## Wallet Connections (Priority: Highest)

- Allow seamless MetaMask integration via Plurality upon selecting "Connect Wallet"
- Display the connected wallet address in the vault interface
- Offer users a robust and easy-to-access logout/disconnect option

## Wallet Adapter Implementation

- The initial implementation, `PluralityWalletAdapter`, manages all MetaMask interactions exclusively via Plurality's API
- Future adapters for additional wallets will follow the same pattern
- All provider logic will remain abstracted from orchestration and product layers

## Transactions (Priority: Highest)

- Enable deposits and withdrawals through Plurality using MetaMask connections
- Provide real-time, step-by-step feedback for all transaction actions

## Governance (Priority: High)

- Empower users to participate in governance on-chain using Plurality-linked wallets

## Error Handling & Messaging (Priority: High)

- Implement robust error detection and deliver clear, helpful notifications for all failure scenarios
- Partner with Plurality infrastructure for comprehensive error management

## Authentication Flow with Auth Provider

- Decouple wallet connection from application authentication
- Upon wallet connection (via orchestrator and plurality-backed adapter), Auth Provider issues a challenge (e.g., nonce/message) to the user for signature
- Wallet Adapter requests the user to sign the challenge via Plurality
- The signed message is sent to the backend Auth Provider for verification
- On the first encounter, a user account is created (signup); otherwise, a session is established (login)
- Session and authentication tokens are managed by the Auth Provider, not the wallet adapter

## Extensibility (Priority: Future)

- Architect modular wallet support so future adapters can integrate other wallets via Plurality with minimal system rework
- Generate documentation ensuring that new wallets can be rapidly onboarded

## Success Metrics

### User-Centric Metrics

- Percentage of successful wallet connections via Plurality
- Conversion rate from connection to completed deposit/withdrawal actions
- Rate of user participation in governance

### Business Metrics

- Growth in unique wallet connections (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Increase in vault TVL (Total Value Locked) linked to Plurality-powered interactions
- Reduction in wallet- or transaction-related support tickets

### Technical Metric

- Failed transaction rates for wallet flows
- Median wallet connection and transaction processing times
- Uptime percentage for Plurality-mediated integration

## Tracking Plan

- Track wallet connection attempts and completion
- Log every deposit and withdrawal event (success/fail)
- Monitor user engagement with governance voting
- Record error and exception events in wallet-related flows
