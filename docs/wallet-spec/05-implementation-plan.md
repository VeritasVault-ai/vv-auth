# Implementation Plan & Resources

## Project Estimate

- Small: 2 weeks (MetaMask via Plurality integration MVP)
- Extensibility Scaffold: additional 1 week post-MVP
- Optimization & Institutional Phases: further work dependent on feedback, estimate 1 week increments

## Team Size & Composition

Lean Team:
- 2 developers (wallet integration, orchestration logic)
- 1 product owner (requirements, coordination, QA)
- Ad-hoc support from Plurality's technical contacts as needed

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MetaMask Integration via Plurality (2 weeks)
- Product owner finalizes requirements and acceptance criteria.

- Deliverable: Live MVP supporting MetaMask via Plurality for all targeted flows.

### Phase 2: Extensibility Scaffold (1 week)

- Design, document, and validate adapter interfaces for additional/future wallets.
- Deliverable: Modular wallet adapter pattern and technical documentation aligned with future needs.

### Phase 3: Optimization & Institutional Pilot (1 week)

- Onboard pilot institutional user(s) and collect feedback on advanced needs (e.g., multi-sig, permissioning).
- Deliverable: Documented technical/user findings and plan for further enhancements.
